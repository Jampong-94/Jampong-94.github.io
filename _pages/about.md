Thanks for visiting my site!


I am a fifth-year Ph.D. Candidate in Finance at the Darla Moore School of Business at the University of South Carolina. I conduct research broadly in the fields of household and behavioral finance, and several of my studies focus directly on issues related to FinTech. 


I teach both managerial finance and real estate for undergraduate business majors at the University of South Carolina.
