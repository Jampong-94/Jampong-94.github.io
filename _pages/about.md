Thanks for visiting my site!


I am a fourth-year Ph.D. Candidate in Finance at the Darla Moore School of Business at the University of South Carolina. I conduct research broadly in the fields of corporate finance, corporate governance, shareholder voting, and stakeholder value maximization and several of my studies use machine learning techniques in these areas. 

I teach  corporate finance for undergraduate business majors at the University of South Carolina and enjoy helping students understand how financial theory applies to real-world decisions.
