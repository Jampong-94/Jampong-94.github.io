Thanks for visiting my site!


I am a fourth-year Ph.D. Candidate in Finance at the Darla Moore School of Business at the University of South Carolina. I will be on the academic job market market in 2024-2025 (this winter). I conduct research broadly in the fields of consumer finance, behavioral finance, and real estate, and several of my studies focus directly on issues related to FinTech. 


I teach both real estate and managerial finance for undergraduate business majors at the University of South Carolina.
